# MicrosoftVision
An android app that uses Microsft's vision api to analyze an image.
In MainActivity.java replace my key with :
public VisionServiceClient visionServiceClient=new VisionServiceRestClient("your_api_key");

This is a basic app that uses Microsoft's Cognitie Services, Vision api to detect features in an image and return the same.
This can be used to detect racy or adult content in an image and identify if the image is good or bad.

Thank you.
